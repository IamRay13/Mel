Hello, Catherine!
 
I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire if you could assist a patient residing at [ADDRESS].
 
This patient is due for a O2 5 YEAR RENEWAL, and we received a prescription for a POC for the patient and we would like to inquire if we have an available POC for this patient and I have attached the prescription.
 
If additional details are needed, please let us know. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.
 
Thank you and have a great day!">POC Availability</option>
     <option value="Hello, James!

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inquire if you could assist a patient residing at [ADDRESS].

The patient is due for an O2 5 YEAR RENEWAL, and the account is currently on hold. Should we proceed with creating a new work order for the O2 5 YEAR RENEWAL, or send the account for branch review to address the hold?

If additional details are needed, please let us know. Your prompt attention to this matter is greatly appreciated.

Thank you and have a great day!">Account is on Hold</option>
  <option value="ADDENDUM EXAMPLE: 

The current document contains incomplete testing information. Specifically, the patient's oxygen saturation (O2) levels were recorded as follows:

O2 is 92% and decreased to 76% on walking and needed 2LPM oxygen to improve to 92%.

To ensure clarity and completeness, we need an addendum that includes these specific indications:

1. Oxygen saturation on room air at rest: 92%
2. Oxygen saturation on room air with exertion: 76%
3. Oxygen saturation during ambulation with 2LPM oxygen: 92%

Please note that we need this completed within 30 days from the appointment on 09/03/2024. If it is not done within this timeframe, we will require another test as per Medicare guidelines.
">Addendum</option>
     <option value="Good morning,
 
We have received multiple signed SWOs, but unfortunately, we can't accept them because if we put a specific doctor's name on the document, they must be the one to sign it. If they are not available, please do not have someone else sign it, as the insurance will reject it.
 
The document we sent is addressed to DOCTORNAME. Please have her sign this document and ensure the dates and signature are in the same format. If the signature is handwritten, make sure the date signed is handwritten as well. If it's electronically signed, make sure the date signed is electronic too.
